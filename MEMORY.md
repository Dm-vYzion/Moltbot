# StoryForge Memory

## Project Overview
- StoryForge is an evolving game being built by Scott with his daughter as the primary playtester.
- Goal: keep the game fun and accessible for kids while still interesting for adults.

## Design Guidelines
- Early content should be beatable by an 8–10 year old without needing perfect play.
- Difficulty should ramp gradually; spikes should be smoothed out unless intentionally designed as a challenge.
- Rewards (treasure, items, story moments) should appear frequently enough to keep younger players engaged.

## Playtest Log (Examples)
- [TODO] Log specific feedback and corresponding changes here over time.
  - Example: "First quest felt too hard -> reduced enemy HP and added a healing item before the fight."
